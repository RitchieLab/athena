  * created by the "save" function in various annie classes.
  * When a file is opened, we check that the first non-commented line contains
  * "ANNIE_FILE <ver>" where <ver> is the version number. This has been done
  * to allow for future changes to file formats used by ANNIE.
  * All save functions should save in the same format. Current version is 1.0.
  *
  * Comments in an ANNIE file are given by a '#'. The rest of the line following '#'
  * is ignored. The member functions of this class return values ignoring any
  * and all comments that may have appeared in between.
