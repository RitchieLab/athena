/** One of the fundamental annie classes - the basic Neuron. This class acts only as a
  * template, and cannot be instantiated. Each neuron has a (unique) label which is specified
  * when creating the neuron. Note that no effort has been made to ensure that the labels
  * are indeed unique, you'll have to take care of that yourself. The MultiLayerNetwork
  * and RadialBasisNetwork for example assign the label of the neuron as:
  * <layer number> * Layer::MAX_LAYER_SIZE + <neuron number in layer>
  *
  * Each Neuron caches the activation, output and error. The getOutput() and getActivation()
  * functions merely check if the cache is valid, if so they return the value in the cache
  * otherwise they force fresh calculation of the output and error.
  * Different types of neurons will have different ways of calculating the output and 
  * error. Hence, the instantiable sub-classes of this class must implement the
  * protected functions _recacheOutput() and _recacheError() which calculate the activation,
  * output and error and update the cache.
  *
  * Also, each sub-class must provide the getClassName() function. Since C++ doesn't have
  * a good class reflection system, this has been provided for some primitive reflection

  * @see InputNeuron
  * @see SimpleNeuron
  * @see CenterNeuron
  *
  * @todo why doesn't it have connect??
  * @todo the link connecting is really slow...
